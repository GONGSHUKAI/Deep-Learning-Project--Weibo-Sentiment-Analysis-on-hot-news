 Deep Learning project by Shukai Gong, Churui Zheng, Zihan Yang, Erfu Guo and Hang Xie

 We quantify and visualize the change in public opinion of the 'Jiang Ping Incident' on Weibo from June 2024 to November 2024. 
 
 We use the [WeiboSpider API](https://github.com/nghuyong/WeiboSpider) API to collect tweet data and use deep learning model to conduct sentiment analysis on the data.
 
 Specifically, we adopt the following deep learning models:
 > BERT + BiLSTM
 > BERT + Transformer
